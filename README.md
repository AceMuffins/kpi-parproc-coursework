# Paralell processing/Inverted index coursework project

## UML Diagrams

The UML folder holds the images as well as the source code for the UML diagrams, written in the [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) language.
These are subject to change.

## Client & Server code

In the code folder you'll find folders for both the client and the server.
The client is able to connect to the local server and query words, print out the list of files the words were found it, and print out one of the files.
The server does... everything else.

TODO:

rewrite whole fucking code because I'm an idiot

Clientside admin functionality

Scheduled index updating

Serverside logging

Pray to Dennis Ritchie that the parallelization works
