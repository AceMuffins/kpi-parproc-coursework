# Paralell processing/Inverted index coursework project

## UML Diagrams

The UML folder holds the images as well as the source code for the UML diagrams, written in the [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) language.
These are subject to change.

## Client & Server code

In the code folder you'll find folders for both the client and the server. Currently the client is a placeholder project that does nothing, and the server only has the inverted index structure and a thread pool realized.
